Task Definition
=================

In company ABC we run quite a few queries against our databases, and the queries have different performance characteristics. We frequently need to work on optimizing them. We want to build a system that allow us to compare different versions of the same query and be able to benchmark the performance of its versions.

Build a system to perform this benchmarking with the following characteristics:

- it is a restful service built with Spring (and optionally Spring Boot)
- it can execute a performance test
- it measures the time for each query to complete (work time)
- exactly one of the performance tests can execute at any point of time against a database installation.
- tests against different database installations can execute in parallel. So if a user starts a test for query Q, this test can execute in parallel against databases A,B,C and collect the results in a "report"

Define a data model, define the rest api and write the code for the service.

Necessary applications
=================

build service: `./mvn spring-boot:run`

*NOTES*: 
- Java 8
- Maven >=3.6.0
- PostgreSQL 9.6
